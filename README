A simple Lunar Lander game for iPad.

The point of the game is to land the spacecraft safely on the surface of the
moon without crash-landing it.  This is a one-button game where you control
the thrusters for the spacecraft.  If you don't press the thrusters enough,
you crash-land.  If you press them too much, you fly back up into space.

To run this game: 

-Get your Xcode development environment set up, instructions from Apple here:
